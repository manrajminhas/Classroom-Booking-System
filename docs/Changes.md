# Reason for not Completing the Entire Scope of the Project: 

## 1. Unfamiliar with Tools:

  - No one in our group had previous experience working with the language typescript or React frameworks, and therefore this lead to us having to spend at least a few days each learning how these frameworks and languages worked before we were able to start the project.
  - Having no familiarity with NestJS added quite a few complications for those who worked mainly on the developing the backend. As well as, this added complications for those who had to attempt to connect the backend to the frontend.

## 2. Very Large Scope:

  - Scope was too expansive within the given timeframe.

## 3. Needs to be Better Group Communication:

  - Our lab was cancelled and therefore our team was not able to meet in person and this ultimately lead to some disconnection within developing this first iteration.
  - Our team needs to start planning more meetings in advance to ensure that everyone is on the same page and understand each part of the product in its entirety.

## 4. Better Timeframe Planning:

  - Us as a team need to start working on parts of the project earlier.
  - We should plan out better deadlines for each aspect and work more closley to achieve these deadlines together.

## 5. Conflicting Priorities:

  - All our team members have had multiple midterms and assignments for other class due during this iteration, at times making it diffuclt to work on the project.
