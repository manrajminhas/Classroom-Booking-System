# Lab 2 

## Duties Pre Lab:

* read the PRD and ADR docs

## Lab Presentations/Exercises

* [Reviewing MRs](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2MayfXKpU08)
* [Basic PM](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eQUnHwbKEkY)

## Interactions

* once the presentations are complete, take a short break (5 mins). Then explain that the standup meetings will begin. Each standup should have each team (vary the start order) explain to you (as the team lead):
  * what they worked on
  * what was an obstacle/hindrance
  * what they plan to do this week

Make notes in this directory for each team's progress/problems. Bring any to me you cannot resolve - like missing team members. 


# Lab 1 Week of Sept 9th

## Learning Objectives
* set up project teams
* get teams to chat and get to know one another
* get teams to decide how to work
* go over the project and Design phase 1
* ensure everyone knows Git/Gitlab
  
## Duties pre lab:

- assign students in section to project teams, max 5. 
  - use the Excel sheet
- go over Project outline and rehearse what to say.
- print out attendance sheet with date, student IDs (use Brightspace)
- populate your teams with the project materials so far. 
  
## Lab Presentations/Exercises

Today's lab is about getting the teams formed, communicating, and setting expectations. 

Start by introducing yourself and then explaining the teams and students on those teams. 

Then, walk through the project milestones and deliverables. The deadlines are on Brightspace and the course README. Don't spend too long on this. The key is to emphasize things may change so they should watch the project changelog. 

Go over the Effective Meetings slides, and the Teams sheets. 

Explain that the team should take 5 minutes and go over the expectations, and present the Hitchhiker html slides.

Take a short break. 

The next phase is about Git and Gitlab experiences. You will assign them to each open the command line, (on their machine), and use Git to make a commit to the README in their team's repo "signing" that they agree to the list of expectations.

At the end of the exercise, each team member should have their name on the README file using the command line.

Then, go over the Gitlab "flow" tutorials. This walks them through the process for Project Management, making MRs and CI.
