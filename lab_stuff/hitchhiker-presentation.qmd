## The Problem: Hitchhikers and Couch Potatoes

- Some team members don't pull their weight.
- This handout provides practical advice for this situation.

## Case Study: Jack the Hitchhiker

- Doesn't contribute to the team.
- Makes excuses.
- The group absorbs the problem, leading to resentment.

## What this group did wrong: Absorbing

- The group covered for Jack's lack of contribution.
- This enables the hitchhiker's behavior.
- By absorbing the problem, you inadvertently train the hitchhiker to take credit for others' work.

## What this group should have done: Mirroring

- Reflect back the dysfunctional behavior.
- Set clear limits and expectations.
- If a team member doesn't contribute, their name doesn't go on the work.

## Henry, the Couch Potato

- Less manipulative than a hitchhiker, but still doesn't pull their weight.
- Deal with them the same way as a hitchhiker: set firm, explicit expectations.

## Characteristics that Enable Hitchhikers

- Unwillingness to let a slacker fail.
- Devotion to 'the good of the team' without common-sense.
- Liking to make others happy at your own expense.

## Conclusion

- You will encounter these behaviors throughout your career.
- It is important to learn to deal with them effectively.
- Set firm expectations and don't let yourself be taken advantage of.
