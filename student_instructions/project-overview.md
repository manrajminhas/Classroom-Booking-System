# Project Overview

The goal of this project is to design, implement, deploy, test, and refactor a substantial software system. In the past we would build a Java system with a simple file data store. Now, with GenAi, we can be more ambitious. 

This project is not, however, *merely* about writing code. It is about understanding system design choices and tradeoffs. [^thus, writing a lot of code is great but also not sufficient for a good mark]

We will do two major iterations. Cycle 1 will involve an initial design followed by implementation work (including testing and deployment). Cycle 2 will take feedback from Cycle 1 and add new features and capabilities to the system. Finally, there will be a Refactoring step where you take on another team's codebase, and a Reflection phase. 

Here is [the project specification](project-spec.md).

## Teams 
The project is completed in teams of 3-5 students. Teams are created by the instructional team to balance skills and abilities. 

Your individual mark and your team's mark **MAY NOT BE CORRELATED**. In particular, if you do not do work on the project, you should expect to fail the course. This means writing code, not just making the presentation slides or writing documentation. You should be able to easily show instructors your contributions, e.g., the commits you made on Gitlab. 

## Use of AI and LLM tools
You should use GenAI in this project. However, uncritical and unthinking application of AI to the project is a) a bad idea generally and b) not helpful for the learning experience you paid for. It's actually pretty easy for us to tell if someone just cut and pasted the output from a prompt to Gemini; the code will not compile, there will be weird library references, etc. 

In this project we are requiring you to use specific AI tools. 

***TODO: needs to be filled in *** 

All use of AI **must** be noted. In addition, in the project you must commit your prompts and details of the use of AI. [^I drew on [this Cloudflare approach](https://www.maxemitchell.com/writings/i-read-all-of-cloudflares-claude-generated-commits/) for inspiration; if it works for them, I reason it should for us too.] 

All development **must** take place on GitLab. You should not be making notes in (e.g.) Google Docs or Office 365. This includes all writing deliverables. In the past students have gotten poorer marks than they expected because too much of their contributions were in places the instructors could not see.

The rationale is that the teaching team needs to see the work that is happening incrementally. Committing large chunks of code or text, especially not originated by yourself, will lead to loss of marks.

> For example, you were tasked with writing the report. You do this in Google Docs so you can leverage their AI tools. Your teammates send you their sections. The day before the final report is due, you copy and paste all the text into Github. I see one commit of 3000 lines by @student1. I have no idea where that text came from, nor how you worked as a team.

## Project Advice

Each student/team member is required to do the following:

1. Follow any updates on this site, Teams, Brightspace, and meet all of the established interim milestones.
2. Attend all the lectures during the semester, as these will prepare you to succeed in this project.
3. Together with your team mates (if any), choose a topic for your project.
4. Contribute equitably throughout the term to the team project in terms of research, presentation, and paper writing.
5. Grade will be determined on a combination of the following:
    - meeting milestones throughout the term
    - Team peer reviews of effort.
    - individual contribution assessments
    - lab engagement and participation
    - Extra points may be given for: challenging projects, original ideas, collaboration with external organizations.

### Ways to get bad marks
2. Letting LLMs do all the analysis work. You can expect me to ask pointed questions about your assumptions, so your team needs to understand what you are doing.
5. Do nothing to help your team. I reserve the right to adjust individual marks if there is evidence someone is not contributing. Not having any evidence of your work in GitHub (commits, discussions) would be a problem. 

# Learning Outcomes - Project
- Apply software patterns and architectural styles to solve design problems
- Understand the value of quality attributes and scenarios in testing potential designs
- Analyse architectural approaches using rigorous techniques
- Understand what decisions are the architecturally significant decisions, and which should be left to developers.
- Languages and notations, including the UML, for abstracting design models.
- Apply AI tools and identify limitations, in order to assist in specifying, implementing and verifying a large software project.
- Leverage collaborative SE tools and processes in a large group to manage deliverables.
