Written assignment. You will reflect on your team's progress, learnings, and AI use, and present this to the lab section. 

## Deliverables
- a set of slides for the presentation
- video recording (e.g., Zoom call) of group discussing the following questions:
  - what did you expect from the project in September?
  - how did that change between then, and now? 
  - what would you do differently from a *technical* POV?
  - what would you do differently from a *non-technical* POV? 
  - how did AI help your team in meeting project requirements? 
  - how did AI impede your performance? 
  
## Considerations
- all team members must be visible, i.e. cameras on, in the video, unless prior arrangement is made with the TA.
