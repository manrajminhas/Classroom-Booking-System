# Team Expectations

In this document, put your names and list the rules and expectations you agree as a team to adopt. You can deal with any or all aspects of the responsibilities outlined in [this document](teampolicies.pdf):

- preparation for and attendance at group meetings, 
- making sure everyone understands all the solutions, 
- communicating frankly but with respect when conflicts arise, etc. 
 
Each team member should add their names to this sheet and then commit it to the repo, indicating acceptance of these expectations and intention to fulfill them. 

These expectations are for your use and benefit-they won’t be graded or commented on unless you specifically ask for comments. They may be used to evaluate individual effort later in the course.

Note, however, that if you make the list fairly thorough without being unrealistic you’ll be giving yourselves the best chance. For example, “We will each solve every problem in every assignment completely before we get together” or “We will get 100 on every assignment” or “We will never miss a meeting” are probably unrealistic, but “We will try to set up the problems individually before meeting” and “We will make sure that anyone who misses a meeting for good cause gets caught up on the work” are realistic.
