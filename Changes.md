# Reason for not Completing the Entire Scope of the Project: 

## Cycle 1
### 1. Unfamiliar with Tools:

  - No one in our group had previous experience working with the language typescript or React frameworks, and therefore this lead to us having to spend at least a few days each learning how these frameworks and languages worked before we were able to start the project.
  - Having no familiarity with NestJS added quite a few complications for those who worked mainly on the developing the backend. As well as, this added complications for those who had to attempt to connect the backend to the frontend.

### 2. Very Large Scope:

  - Scope was too expansive within the given timeframe.

### 3. Needs to be Better Group Communication:

  - Our lab was cancelled and therefore our team was not able to meet in person and this ultimately lead to some disconnection within developing this first iteration.
  - Our team needs to start planning more meetings in advance to ensure that everyone is on the same page and understand each part of the product in its entirety.

### 4. Better Timeframe Planning:

  - Us as a team need to start working on parts of the project earlier.
  - We should plan out better deadlines for each aspect and work more closley to achieve these deadlines together.

### 5. Conflicting Priorities:

  - All our team members have had multiple midterms and assignments for other class due during this iteration, at times making it diffuclt to work on the project.

## Cycle 2

While we improved on our implementation from Cycle 1, some features have been left incomplete. These include:
- Some of the registrar classroom/time management options. Respecifying open hours and capacity for existing rooms is not supported. Workaround: delete and readd the room with the new capacity.
- Schedule integrity for the registrar. We were unable to ensure that every booking fully utilized its associated room's capacity, though we did highlight bookings where less than 50% of the room's capacity was being used.


### 1. Need better group communication   

  - Requirements and tasks were often left up in the air due to infrequent meetings and lack of communication through the week.

### 2. Not allowing ourselves enough time to finish

  - As a good chunk of work was not started until the second half of the week the sprint was due, there was simply not enough time for the group members who started later to finish their portions.

### 3. Losing a group member

  - Becoming a group of 3 slightly hindered our ability to fairly divide work according to team members' strengths and weaknesses.

### 4. Division of work

  - An unfair division of work led to some team members taking on cognitive burden and feeling burnt out, unable to motivate themselves to work on the project.
