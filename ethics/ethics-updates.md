# Introduction

This document tracks all of the proposed changes we will need to make to the ethics application of the study. Please use strikethrough to cross off the items that have already been updated in RAIS.

# Amendment #1

- Add Ori to the list of researchers
- Quinton mentioned that data storage concerns of non-Uvic approved gen AI tools might be a problem. As Uvic students are able to use copilot pro he suggests us to mention this as a course-requirement in the ethics. 
- Don't make them use a uvic email address to use a service that uvic hasn't approved.
